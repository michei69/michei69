[00:25.83]Resting in fields of grass
[00:32.96]Flowers sleep on our backs
[00:39.27]Hold my hand when you speak
[00:45.85]Let me know when we're free
[00:52.85][01:46.72]When I am fine, romance will die
[01:07.26][02:02.45]I'll be alright, You'll learn to lie
[01:20.95]On my way through the field
[01:29.15]Seeing you have not healed
[01:34.12]Purposely touch your scars
[01:40.99]I'm okay with your harm
