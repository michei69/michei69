[00:31.35]Dissipate from within
[00:38.67]Mitigate wounded skin
[00:46.13]Disappear, wearing thin
[00:53.50]I am clear, infinite
[01:00.07][01:59.50][02:58.88]You're letting go
[01:07.71][02:06.90][03:05.96]I think I know
[01:15.23][02:13.96][03:13.34]Our colors fade
[01:22.45][02:21.65][03:20.71]When fears are made
[01:30.46]Wash away pastel boy
[01:37.81]Trouble me, intently
[01:44.78]Hide inside empty trees
[01:52.09]Earth of black made of me
[02:28.97]
