[01:04.34]What have they done
[01:12.57]You've done no harm
[01:20.45]Red water runs
[01:28.48]Through fragile arms
[01:35.92][01:52.50][02:39.96][02:56.50][04:15.91][04:31.97][04:47.90][05:03.87]I close my eyes and believe that you are here

[02:08.44]My hate's immense
[02:16.15]His name's in vain
[02:24.56]Destroying God
[02:32.55]Will cure my pain
