[00:59.82]Take a look at me with blurry eyes
[01:07.14]Erase the purity encased in lies

[02:06.90][02:21.53][03:35.50][03:50.24]Immurement, I've got nothing left to hide
[02:28.53]Take a look at me, my guard is down
[02:35.99]Did you ever think I'd wear the crown?
[02:58.80]Don't get close to me, you mustn't touch
[03:05.56]My fragility an ailing crutch
